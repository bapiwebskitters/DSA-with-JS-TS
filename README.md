# Data Structures and Algorithms(DSA with JS/TS)

**Let‚Äôs build a step-by-step DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) learning roadmap that takes you from beginner to advanced in a structured, practical way.**

***This roadmap is designed for JavaScript / TypeScript learners, but the concepts are universal.***

## üß≠ DSA Learning Roadmap( Step-by-Step)

### üìç Phase 1: Foundations (Programming Essentials)

***Before touching DSA, make sure you‚Äôre comfortable with:***

- ‚úÖ Variables, Data Types, Operators
- ‚úÖ Loops and Conditionals (for, while, if-else)
- ‚úÖ Functions and Recursion
- ‚úÖ Arrays and Objects
- ‚úÖ Time and Space Complexity (Big O Notation)

üìò Goal: Understand how to analyze the performance of code.

### üìç Phase 2: Core Data Structures

***Learn how data is stored and accessed efficiently.***

#### 1. Arrays

- Introduction & Operations (insert, delete, search)
- Two Pointer Technique
- Sliding Window Technique
- Common Problems:
- Reverse an array
- Move zeros to the end
- Find sub-array with given sum

#### 2. Strings

- Basic operations (compare, reverse, substring)
- Pattern searching
- Palindrome check
- Anagram detection
- Common Problems:
- Longest substring without repeating characters
- String compression

#### 3. Linked List

- Singly, Doubly, and Circular Linked Lists
- Operations: insertion, deletion, reversal
- Floyd‚Äôs cycle detection
- Merge two sorted linked lists

#### 4. Stack

- Implementation using array or linked list
- Applications:
Balanced parentheses
Infix to Postfix
Next Greater Element

#### 5. Queue

- Implementation and circular queue
- Applications:
Sliding window maximum
BFS (Breadth-First Search)

### üìç Phase 3: Advanced Data Structures

- Go deeper into structured storage and manipulation.

#### 6. Hashing

- Hash tables / Maps / Sets
- Collision handling
- Applications:
Count frequency of elements
Sub-array sum equals k
Detect duplicates

#### 7. Trees

- Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees (BST)
- Tree Traversals (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, Level Order)
- Height, Diameter, Lowest Common Ancestor
- Balanced Trees (AVL, Red-Black Tree ‚Äì basic understanding)

#### 8. Heaps / Priority Queue

- Min-Heap and Max-Heap
- Applications:
Kth largest/smallest element
Heap sort
Merging K sorted lists

#### 9. Graphs

- Representation (Adjacency list, matrix)
- Traversal (BFS, DFS)
- Shortest Path Algorithms:
Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm
Bellman-Ford
Floyd-Warshall
Minimum Spanning Tree (Kruskal, Prim)
Topological Sort
Detecting cycles in directed/undirected graphs

#### 10. Tries (Prefix Trees)

- Autocomplete
- Word search problems

### üìç Phase 4: Algorithms

Learn how to solve problems efficiently.

#### 11. Sorting Algorithms

- Bubble, Insertion, Selection Sort
- Merge Sort, Quick Sort (Divide and Conquer)
- Counting, Radix, and Bucket Sort (Advanced)

#### 12. Searching Algorithms

- Linear & Binary Search
- Ternary Search
- Search in Rotated Sorted Array

#### 13. Recursion & Backtracking

- Permutations and Combinations
- Subsets / Power Set
- Sudoku Solver
- N-Queens Problem

#### 14. Divide and Conquer

- Merge Sort, Quick Sort
- Binary Search Variants
- Matrix Multiplication

#### 15. Dynamic Programming (DP)

- Introduction to DP (Top-down vs Bottom-up)
- 1D DP: Fibonacci, Climbing Stairs
- 2D DP: Knapsack, Subset Sum, Grid Path
- Advanced:
Longest Increasing Subsequence
Longest Common Subsequence
Matrix Chain Multiplication

#### 16. Greedy Algorithms

- Activity selection
- Huffman Encoding
- Fractional Knapsack
- Minimum Spanning Tree

### üìç Phase 5: Practice & Systematic Problem Solving

**Start with easy problems from platforms like:**

- LeetCode, GeeksForGeeks, CodeStudio, or HackerRank
- Gradually move to medium ‚Üí hard problems.
- Focus on patterns (e.g., Sliding Window, Binary Search, DP on Strings).
- Learn how to optimize solutions using better data structures.

### üìç Phase 6: Advanced Topics (Optional but Valuable)

- Segment Trees / Fenwick Tree (BIT)
- Disjoint Set Union (Union-Find)
- Graph Coloring / Topological DP
- Bit Manipulation
- Computational Geometry Basics

### üìç Phase 7: Project Integration

- Use DSA concepts in real-world applications:
- Search & Recommendation Systems
- Pathfinding (Graphs) in Games
- Text Autocomplete (Tries)
- Caching (HashMap + Queue = LRU Cache)
- Scheduler (Heap-based Priority Queue)
